# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- 最小、但能用的作品，下面是在 [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/mvp-in-software-development-a-complete-overview/) 的網站上可以看到的說明:
> In software development, **MVP** stands for **Minimum Viable(可行的) Product**. It is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with the minimum features required to satisfy early adopters. 

> The primary purpose of an MVP is to quickly release a product to market with just enough features to attract early customers and gather feedback for future development.
